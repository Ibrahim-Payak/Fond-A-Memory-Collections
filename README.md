1. As shown in folder structer I have devided this project into two parts: front-end(client) & back-end (server).
2. Front end build on react, redux & using others library like material-ui, axios, moment, React-file-base64.
3. Back end side I have used Node.js & mongodb as database, express library also used for routing.
